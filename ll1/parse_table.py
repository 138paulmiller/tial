'''LL(1) Parse Table

# Constructs an LL(1) parse table from a given Grammer.
    The table is map of nonterminal maps. Table = { nonterminal : { first, rule} }
    Each nonterminal is mapped to a rule by one of it's firsts.
    Allows rules access as table[terminal][nonterminal]
    If terminal is not in table[nonterminal] then reject terminal
    
    Remember, if two distinct rules are mapped from table[nonterminal][terminal]
         then the grammer is not LL(1) !!

# Grammer : map with each nonterminal key is mapped to a list of production rules

# Rules : an in order list of terminals and nonterminals.
 
# Terminals : symbols that are not mapped to production rules

# Epsilon  :  a special terminal that allows nonterminal to terminal  
  
# Symbols : the tag used to identify token tags(terminals) and rule tags (nonterminals)
 
# First set : the set of possible first terminals that match with a production rule for a nonterminal.
              If a terminal parsed is a e, and e is also within the first set of S.
              For each rule for a nonterminal, each rule's first symbol
              If the first symbol is a terminal then add it to first set
              If the first symbol is a nonterminal and not equal to first set's nonterminal
                then union the nonterminals first into first set


# Follow set : the set of terminals that follow a nonterminal symbol in any given production rule.
                For a nonterminal in rule r.
                If the nonterminal has nothing following it or follows EPSILON in rule, 
                    then union the follow set of the nonterminal that is mapped to rule r,
                    the parent symbol, if it is not the same.
                If the following symbol in rule is a nonterminal, 
                    then union the follow set with the following nonterminal's first set. 
                    If one of the firsts is epsilon, then union the follow set of parent symbol 
                By default START is followed by EOI

# Example Grammer and Table Constructed
    Nonterminals : S, E
    Terminals    : a, +, EPSILON
    Grammer = 
    {
        E : [[T, A]],
        A : [[+, T, A],
             [EPSILON]
            ]
        T : [[a]]
    }
    
    first_set(E) = [a]              # first set of T
    first_set(A) = [+, EPSILON]     # + and  epsilon are terminal so add 
    first_set(T) = [a]              # a is terminal so add

    follow_set(E) = [EOI]           # is start so default follows EOI   
    follow_set(A) = [EOI]           # A follows nothing in each rule, so union the follow of rules symbol that is not A,
                                      so follow set of E  
    follow_set(T) = [+, EOI]        # T is followed by A, so follow first set of A, however, epsilon is in first so union
                                    # follow set of A

    Table =
    {
        E : { a : [T, A], }
        A : { + : [T, A], EOI : [EPSILON] }
        T : { a : [a] }
    }

        | a   |  +  | EOI

    E   | T A |     |
    A   |     | T A | EPSILON
